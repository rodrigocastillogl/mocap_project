# Recurrent Model for Human Motion Prediction

This is the implementation of the short-term model described in the paper:

> Dario Pavllo, David Grangier, and Michael Auli. QuaterNet: A Quaternion-based Recurrent Model for Human Motion. In British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), 2018.

It is a copy of the repository made by Dario Pavllo and Michael Auli ([QuaterNet](https://github.com/facebookresearch/QuaterNet))
where I implement some changes to try new features in the data representation and the network architecture.
